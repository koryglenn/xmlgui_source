# xmlgui_source
Configuration and Source file for the XML GUI
This project was completed several years ago.  Matthew Ramsey (matthewlramsey@gmail.com) a co-op from Georgia Tech at the time, did the coding while I acted as the product lead and manager.  
The goal was to create an enhanced channel link in a UI of our Cable Set Top boxes when a new guide product deployed but didn't include the features of the previous client.
This repository contains the source code for the tool.
